# EasyPnP
Network administrators often deal with a problem how to deploy a lot of network devices in a short period of time, especially LAN infrastructure in campus networks. It is necessary to unbox each new device, upgrade it to a particular IOS version and upload the right configuration. In case we have to deploy several devices it might be an easy task, but what if there are hundreds? It may become a tough task with a big chance to make a mistake. The goal of EasyPnP solution is to simplify the PnP (Plug and Play) process as much as possible to deploy new or existing devices easy and intuitive, without the need to use Cisco PI (Prime Infrastracture). The only prerequisites for successful implementation are a filled in xls spreadsheet with required devices details and a configuration template. Another use may be to mass-unify configurations of large number of devices, where some changes are needed. Simply erase the devices and re-provision them. My EasyPnP solution together with Cisco APIC-EM (Application Policy Infrastructure Controller - Enterprise Module) or Cisco DNA-C (Digital Network Architecture - Center) is able to effectively deal with a problem of preparation complex configuration template and it can make mass deployment of network devices fault proof, simple and quick. And it can add these devices to Cisco ISE (Identity Services Engine) as well. It is suitable for customers who want to profit from simplified network devices workflow with less effort.
